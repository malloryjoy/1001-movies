# You've Never Seen It? 

You've Never Seen It? is a part search engine, part database, application designed to track progress through the film anthology "1001 Movies to See Before You Die" by Steven Jay Schneider.

## Project Origins

In college, I majored in English and minored in both Computer Science and Film/TV studies. I went into my film classes thinking that I would be tasked to take a critical look at some of the most iconic movies in cinematic history. Not the case! I graduated with the same amount of passion for movies in general, and would have nothing to say for myself if a film expert asked me what I thought of Fellini or Lars Von Trier. 

Enter "1001 Movies to See Before You Die," a decades long anthology series (with annual revisions) that compiles the best films created by year, spanning all the way back to 1902! 

This list provided me with an excellent jumping off point to have a more developed cache. That said, 1001 movies is a lot! As well, that title came at the first print of the anthology. Since then, films have been added and removed! The true number is somewhere around 1,120 movies. 

After receiving a copy of the 2019 print, I decided to make it my mission to watch all 1100+ movies. However, I kept finding myself wondering if certain movies that were cult classics or sleeper hits made the cut. As well, I kept trying to figure out how many, and which films from this list I've already seen! 

I wanted to create a system in which a person could search through the list of movies to find if their favorite films made the cut, as well as track how many of these "essential" films they've seen.

Enter "You've Never Seen It?" a title inspired by a [Vine](https://youtu.be/BubEPFxqahg?t=55) (rest in peace, my love). 


## How It Works

### The Search Engine

The 2019 edition of "1001 Movies to See Before You Die" has been converted into a list, sorted by name, year of release, title, genre, and featured actors (for example, though not technically receiving "star billing" in the film, one could search for "The Asphalt Jungle" by looking up "Marilyn Monroe"). Users can search by these parameters to determine which movies with that parameter have made the list. 

### The Tracking Feature 

Users can use "You've Never Seen It?" to track their progress in chipping away at this list! After an account has been created, the user is prompted with the full list of films, which they can "check" off to create an initial database of movies they've already seen. 

As they progress through the list, they can log in and use the database to search for the film(s) they've seen. The result will allow the user to again "check" off the film, which will add to the pre-existing database created from the first list. 

## Where Does the Code Come In

This project operates on a basic landing page created with HTML and CSS. The database has been created with SQL. As of writing this, I am unsure what features will require Javascript, though I am certain I will need it! As well, I believe I will be using MongoDB or a Google API to create the user tracking aspect of the project. 

I intend to update as time goes on in the creation of this project. 

## My Process 

I am sure this process will receive tweaks that will go beyond this rudimentary roadmap. 

1. Create a SQL database that organizes each film by title, genre, year, decade, and featured actors. 

2. Create search feature to allow people to search through the list. 

3. Create account creation capability. 

4. Add Checkbox feature to allow account owners to add/save films to their list. 

## Challenges and Future Adjustments  

Looking at it from an eagle-eye view, I think this will be my most tricky/arduous project to date! My biggest challenge with this project will be actually completing it to be experienced in a user friendly way. Ideally, I'd like to update this project down the road with addendums for films that WERE on the list but were removed, as well as new additions each year.  

### A note I feel necessary to include 
I do not consider this list a barometer for how educated one can be with regard to film. It is not my opinion that one HAS to view all 1001+ films to be a film expert. This list, while having the credibility of being compiled by experts, theorists, critics, and historians, does not include much by way of films created/written by women, POC, nor LGBTQIA+ (much less a combination of any). It is not the be-all, end all of cinematic history. This list should act as an entertaining but educational jumping off point, and not as an opportunity to gatekeep a stronger appreciation of cinema. 

## Conclusion  
"You've Never Seen It?" offers the average film enthusiast a chance to expand their horizons outside the cozy classics they know. I hope any who use this application develop a greater appreciation for the magic of the movies!
